# 3.2 Major Bribe Marketplaces

### Votium

Votium has established itself as the dominant platform for Convex (vlCVX) bribes, processing hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives. The platform's success stems from several key design decisions:

**Focused Approach**: By specializing exclusively in vlCVX bribes, Votium could optimize its interface and processes for this specific use case. This focus enabled rapid iteration and improvement based on user feedback.

**Automated Distribution**: Votium handles all aspects of bribe distribution, calculating voter shares and executing payments automatically. This automation reduces operational overhead for both bribers and voters.

**Economic Efficiency**: The platform's fee structure (4% of bribes, with 96% going to voters) strikes a balance between sustainability and attractiveness to users. The efficiency is remarkable: bribers typically see $2.59 in directed CRV emissions for every $1 spent on bribes.

**Strategic Importance**: With over $46 million in total volume processed, Votium has become critical infrastructure for the Curve ecosystem. Major protocols depend on it for liquidity management, making it a systemically important platform.

The platform operates on a bi-weekly cycle aligned with Curve's gauge votes. Protocols deposit bribes during the active period, voters delegate their vlCVX to Votium, and rewards are automatically distributed after voting concludes. This streamlined process has made Votium the default choice for most protocols seeking to influence Curve gauges.

### bribe.crv

Created by Andre Cronje, bribe.crv pioneered the concept of explicit vote markets in DeFi. While simpler than later platforms, it established important precedents:

**Direct Model**: Unlike Votium's delegation system, bribe.crv allows veCRV holders to maintain direct control over their votes while still earning bribes. This appeals to users who want more active governance participation.

**Permissionless Creation**: Any protocol can create bribe offers without permission or curation, embodying DeFi's permissionless ethos. This openness enabled rapid experimentation with different bribe strategies.

**Historical Significance**: As the first major bribe platform, bribe.crv proved the concept and paved the way for more sophisticated implementations. Many design patterns used by later platforms originated here.

### Hidden Hand

Redacted Cartel's Hidden Hand represents the evolution of bribe markets into generalized infrastructure supporting multiple protocols:

**Multi-Protocol Support**: Hidden Hand supports marketplaces for numerous protocols including:

* Aura Finance (Balancer's Convex)
* Balancer (direct veBAL)
* Floor DAO
* Frax Finance
* Ribbon Finance
* Tokemak

This diversification creates network effects and economies of scale.

**Rapid Adoption**: The platform has seen remarkable growth, particularly in the Balancer ecosystem. After launching Balancer bribes, veBAL participation rates increased dramatically, demonstrating the platform's effectiveness at mobilizing voters.

**Strategic Partnerships**: Hidden Hand's partnership with Balancer DAO showcases sophisticated business development:

* Balancer redirects treasury yield as bribes through Hidden Hand
* Hidden Hand reduces fees from 4% to 1% exclusively for Balancer
* Both parties benefit from increased activity and efficiency

This type of protocol-level partnership represents the maturation of bribe markets from simple tools to strategic infrastructure.

**Technical Innovation**: Hidden Hand introduced several improvements:

* Better user interfaces for both bribers and voters
* More sophisticated reward calculation mechanisms
* Integration with multiple wallet types and delegation systems
* Real-time analytics and reporting

### Paladin and Quest

Paladin introduced important innovations in bribe market design, particularly through their Quest system:

**Downside Protection**: The Quest model addresses a key risk in traditional bribe markets. If a protocol is outbid, they typically lose their entire bribe budget. Quest returns funds proportionally based on votes received, reducing risk for bribers.

**Dual Market Approach**: While others focused on gauge weight voting, Paladin recognized that boost capacity (the ability to earn higher rewards) also has value. Their Warden product creates markets for veCRV boost, expanding the vote market concept.

**Sophisticated Strategies**: Paladin helps protocols optimize their bribe strategies:

* Market price analysis and recommendations
* Multi-week campaign planning
* ROI tracking and optimization
* Integration with protocol treasuries

**Case Study Success**: Paladin's own use of Quest demonstrates the model's effectiveness. By owning 80% of their liquidity and using Quest for gauge votes, they acquired over 80,000 CRV in two months with minimal risk.

### Bribe Protocol

Bribe Protocol represents the commoditization of vote markets, offering infrastructure for any protocol to create their own marketplace:

**Generalized Infrastructure**: Rather than operating marketplaces directly, Bribe Protocol provides the smart contracts and interfaces for protocols to run their own vote markets.

**Expansion Beyond Curve**: While initially focused on Curve/Convex, the platform's architecture supports any vote-escrow token system. This positions it well for the proliferation of veToken models.

**Decentralization Focus**: By enabling permissionless market creation, Bribe Protocol embodies DeFi's decentralization ethos more fully than curated platforms.
