# 1.3.1 Treasury Diversification and Token Swaps

One of the most common forms of DAO-to-DAO collaboration involves treasury token swaps. These arrangements serve multiple strategic purposes beyond simple diversification. By exchanging governance tokens, protocols create aligned incentives that go beyond traditional business partnerships.

**Risk Mitigation**: Diversifying treasury holdings beyond native tokens provides protection against market volatility and creates more stable funding for operations. This diversification is particularly important for protocols with significant ongoing expenses or long development timelines.

**Alignment of Interests**: Creating mutual stakes in each other's success ensures that protocols have skin in the game beyond mere partnership agreements. This alignment often leads to deeper collaboration and mutual support during challenging periods.

**Governance Participation**: Token swaps enable cross-protocol voting and influence, allowing partners to have a voice in decisions that might affect their collaboration. This participation can range from passive support to active involvement in strategic decisions.

**Strategic Signaling**: Public token swaps demonstrate long-term partnership commitment to both communities and the broader market. This signaling can attract users, developers, and additional partners who value stability and strategic thinking.

A typical token swap structure involves protocols agreeing to exchange $5 million to $10 million worth of their respective governance tokens, often with vesting schedules of 2-4 years and lockup periods to ensure long-term alignment. Governance rights may activate immediately or follow a graduated schedule based on partnership milestones.
