# 1.3.3 Meta-governance Mechanisms

Meta-governance involves one protocol participating in another's governance processes, creating layers of influence and coordination that can amplify the impact of governance participation.

**Direct Voting**: Using held tokens to vote on partner proposals allows protocols to support initiatives that align with shared objectives. This direct participation can be particularly powerful when coordinated across multiple partners.

**Delegation Arrangements**: Formal delegation of voting power can create more efficient governance participation, especially for protocols with limited resources for active governance. These arrangements often include specific guidelines for how delegated power should be used.

**Joint Governance Committees**: Cross-protocol working groups can tackle complex challenges that affect multiple protocols. These committees often have delegated authority to make certain decisions without requiring full governance votes from all participating DAOs.

**Governance Mining**: Incentivizing participation in partner governance creates active engagement beyond passive token holding. These incentives can include rewards for voting, proposal creation, or other governance activities.
