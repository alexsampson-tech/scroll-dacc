# 1.3.2 Liquidity Coordination

Strategic governance can direct liquidity incentives to create deeper markets and better user experiences across protocols. This coordination goes beyond simple liquidity mining to create sustainable liquidity networks that benefit all participants.

**Joint Liquidity Mining Programs**: Coordinated incentive campaigns that align rewards across protocols can create powerful network effects. These programs often feature shared costs and synchronized timing to maximize impact while minimizing individual protocol expenses.

**Cross-protocol Gauge Voting**: Using combined governance power to direct emissions creates multiplicative effects on liquidity depth. Protocols can coordinate their voting to support pools that benefit their shared users or strategic objectives.

**Liquidity Bootstrapping**: Established protocols can support new product launches by providing initial liquidity or directing incentives. This support can dramatically reduce the cost and risk of launching new products or expanding to new chains.

**Stablecoin Partnerships**: Ensuring deep liquidity for protocol-native stablecoins requires coordination across multiple venues and chains. Strategic partnerships can create the network effects necessary for new stablecoins to achieve critical mass.
