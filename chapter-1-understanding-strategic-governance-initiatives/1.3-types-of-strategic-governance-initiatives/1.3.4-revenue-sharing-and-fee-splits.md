# 1.3.4 Revenue Sharing and Fee Splits

Protocols can create sustainable partnerships through economic arrangements that align financial incentives over the long term. These arrangements go beyond simple fee sharing to create integrated economic systems.

**Integration Fees**: Sharing revenue from cross-protocol features ensures that both parties benefit from successful integrations. These fees can be structured as fixed percentages or dynamic rates based on usage volume.

**Referral Programs**: Compensating partners for user acquisition creates sustainable growth mechanisms. Modern referral programs often include tiered rewards based on user quality and lifetime value.

**Joint Product Revenue**: Splitting fees from collaborative products ensures aligned incentives in product development and maintenance. These arrangements often include provisions for covering development costs and ongoing support.

**Performance-based Arrangements**: Tying compensation to measurable outcomes ensures that partnerships deliver real value. These arrangements might include bonuses for reaching user targets or penalties for missing service levels.
