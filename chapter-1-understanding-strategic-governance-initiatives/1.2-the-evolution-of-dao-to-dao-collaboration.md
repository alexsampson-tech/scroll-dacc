# 1.2 The Evolution of DAO-to-DAO Collaboration

The concept of strategic governance emerged as the DeFi ecosystem matured and protocols began to recognize the limitations of operating in isolation. Early DeFi protocols competed fiercely for users and liquidity, often engaging in vampire attacks and aggressive competitive strategies that, while sometimes successful in the short term, often damaged the overall ecosystem. However, as the space evolved, leaders began to recognize that collaboration could expand the entire pie rather than just redistributing existing value.

### Timeline of Strategic Governance Evolution:

**2020**: The year marked early experiments with protocol partnerships, primarily focused on technical integrations. These initial collaborations were often informal and limited in scope, but they laid the groundwork for more sophisticated partnerships. Protocols began to recognize that interoperability could create network effects benefiting all participants.

**2021**: This period saw the rise of meta-governance with Index Coop pioneering new models, and the beginning of the Curve Wars which would reshape how protocols think about liquidity and governance power. The introduction of vote-escrowed tokens created new dynamics around governance participation and value accrual.

**2022**: The formalization of DAO-to-DAO treasury swaps and revenue-sharing agreements became common practice. Protocols developed standardized frameworks for partnerships, and the first governance aggregation platforms emerged to facilitate cross-protocol coordination.

**2023**: The emergence of strategic alliances and cross-chain governance initiatives reflected the maturing multi-chain ecosystem. Protocols began forming long-term partnerships that went beyond simple integrations to include shared development resources and aligned roadmaps.

**2024-2025**: The current era has seen the maturation of governance coordination frameworks and standardized partnership models. Professional governance facilitation services have emerged, and sophisticated economic models for value sharing have become the norm rather than the exception.
