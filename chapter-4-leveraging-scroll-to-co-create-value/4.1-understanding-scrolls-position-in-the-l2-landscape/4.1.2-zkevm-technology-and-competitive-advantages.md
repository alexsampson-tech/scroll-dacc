# 4.1.2 zkEVM Technology and Competitive Advantages

In a[ blog post](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html) from 2022, Vitalik Buterin described different types of zkEVMs, highlighting each type’s trade-offs between compatibility with Ethereum and efficiency of zero-knowledge proof generation. **Type 1 zkEVMs** are fully Ethereum-equivalent, aiming for perfect replication of Ethereum's execution logic, making them ideal for both L1 verification and rollups, but with the trade-off of slower prover times. **Type 2 zkEVMs** retain exact EVM equivalence but slightly modify surrounding infrastructure to improve performance, while **Type 2.5** introduces changes like adjusting gas costs to further ease proving without deeply altering the EVM itself. **Type 3 zkEVMs** drop full EVM compatibility in favor of faster proof times, skipping certain complex features or precompiles, though most applications will still work with minor adjustments. Meanwhile, **Type 4 zkEVMs** abandon the EVM entirely and compile directly from high-level languages to ZK-friendly bytecode, maximizing efficiency but sacrificing compatibility with EVM-level tooling, addresses, and developer workflows. Each type has builders currently contributing, and projects may evolve from lower to higher types over time.

zkEVMs offer a few advantages over the other types of L2 scaling technologies. First, traditional ZK-Rollups are application-specific. This means that building composable apps and migrating existing apps from Ethereum mainnet can be challenging. Fully Ethereum-compatible zkEVMs are easier to build generalized applications on and it’s simpler to re-deploy existing applications from mainnet. Security is another advantage; all L2 transactions are verified on the underlying L1 through validity proofs. This leaves zkEVMs free to focus on cost reduction and finality speed. Unlike Optimistic Rollups, which need to post all transaction data onchain, zkEVMs only need to publish the final state changes onchain. This lower cost to post batched data on Ethereum mainnet is passed on to application builders, and in turn, the end users of the zkEVM. In terms of finality, Optimistic Rollups typically require a week or two for a challenge period to be completed before there is proof of the transaction validity. ZK-Rollups, including zkEVMs, mathematically prove the validity of the transactions without the need for a challenge period. A final point in favor of zkEVMs comes in the form of developer network effects. “Ethereum equivalence” enables zkEVMs to access Ethereum’s existing developer ecosystem and network tooling, embracing the EVM’s status as a standard across the industry.
