# Module Overview

### **Overview and Learning Outcomes**

Welcome to Week 5 of the Scroll Delegate Accelerator (D/Acc) program. This module explores how strategic governance can serve as a powerful growth mechanism for DAOs, with a particular focus on DAO-to-DAO collaboration and partnership strategies. As the decentralized ecosystem matures, the ability to identify, negotiate, and execute strategic governance initiatives has become crucial for sustainable growth and value creation.

In the rapidly evolving landscape, we are discovering that success is increasingly interconnected. The traditional competitive mindset is giving way to collaborative frameworks where protocols can leverage each other's strengths, share resources, and create mutual value. This module will equip you with the knowledge and tools to navigate this complex terrain, with special attention to how Scroll's unique position as a zkEVM Layer 2 can be leveraged for strategic partnerships between Scroll and other ecosystems.

By the end of this module, trainees will be able to:

1. **Identify strategic governance opportunities** that involve partnerships between DAOs to help drive mutual growth and ecosystem expansion
2. **Research and analyze historical case studies**, including the Curve Wars, Index Coop's meta-governance activities, and Aave's strategic partnerships to extract lessons and best practices
3. **Apply frameworks for DAO negotiation and coordination**, including joint proposals, token swaps, and other meta-governance mechanisms
4. **Leverage Scroll's unique position in the Layer 2 landscape** to create partnership proposals aligned with the DAO's goals and processes
5. **Draft comprehensive governance proposals** for Scroll DAO that outline theoretical DAO-to-DAO collaborations, demonstrating clarity and alignment with Scroll's long-term vision

### What this Module Covers

This module provides a comprehensive exploration of strategic governance as a growth mechanism, covering theoretical foundations, practical applications, and real-world case studies. The curriculum includes the evolution and theory of strategic governance initiatives in DeFi, detailed case studies of successful and failed DAO collaborations, practical frameworks for negotiation and coordination, revenue-sharing models and partnership structures, Scroll-specific opportunities in the L2 ecosystem, and hands-on proposal writing and evaluation exercises.\


### Who this Module is for

This module is designed for aspiring and current DAO delegates seeking to understand strategic governance at a deep level, protocol contributors interested in business development and partnerships, community members who want to contribute meaningfully to strategic decision-making, and anyone interested in the intersection of governance, strategy, and growth in Web3. The content assumes basic familiarity with DAO governance but builds from foundational concepts to advanced strategies.
