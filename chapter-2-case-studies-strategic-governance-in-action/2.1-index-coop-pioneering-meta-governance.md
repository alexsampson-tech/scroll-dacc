# 2.1 Index Coop: Pioneering Meta-governance

### Background

Index Coop emerged in October 2020 with the vision of creating decentralized index products for the crypto ecosystem. The protocol's flagship product, DPI (DeFi Pulse Index), was designed as a market-capitalization-weighted index of leading DeFi tokens. However, the nature of this product inadvertently positioned Index Coop as one of the most influential meta-governance participants in DeFi.

The creation of DPI required Index Coop to hold significant quantities of governance tokens from protocols like Aave, Compound, Uniswap, YFI, and Balancer. This design choice, initially motivated by the need to create an accurate index product, resulted in Index Coop inheriting substantial voting power across multiple major DeFi protocols. The realization of this governance power marked a turning point in how the DeFi community thought about protocol interactions and influence.

### The Meta-governance Innovation

The innovation of Index Coop's meta-governance system lies not just in the accumulation of voting power, but in how that power is democratically controlled by INDEX token holders. This creates a unique situation where holding INDEX tokens provides indirect influence over multiple major DeFi protocols through a single governance token.

The meta-governance process is elegantly designed to balance efficiency with democratic participation. When external protocols have governance votes, Index Coop mirrors these proposals on their own Snapshot platform. INDEX holders can then vote on how Index Coop should use its voting power in the external protocol. This system ensures that the concentrated voting power of DPI's holdings is directed according to the collective will of the Index Coop community.

### Governance Process Details

The meta-governance voting period is carefully structured to ensure proper participation while meeting external protocol deadlines. Votes end 24 hours before the underlying protocol's governance vote closes, providing buffer time for execution and addressing any technical issues. This timing mechanism has proven crucial for maintaining reliable participation across multiple protocols with varying governance schedules.

The process involves several key steps that ensure transparency and community control. First, when a governance vote is called for on supported protocols (currently including Aave, Compound, Uniswap, Balancer, and Yearn), the proposal is automatically duplicated on Index Coop's Snapshot page. Community members holding INDEX tokens can then participate in determining how Index Coop's substantial voting power should be directed.

A critical aspect of the system is the 5% quorum requirement. If this threshold is reached, the Index Coop multisig executes the community's decision using the full weight of tokens held by DPI. The voting is winner-take-all, meaning that even a slim majority directs the entire voting power, maximizing the impact of Index Coop's participation.

Recognizing that achieving quorum can be challenging, Index Coop implemented an important failsafe mechanism. The Meta Governance Committee, consisting of five elected members serving limited terms, can step in to vote on behalf of the community when quorum is not reached. This ensures that Index Coop's valuable voting power is not wasted due to voter apathy while maintaining democratic oversight through the committee election process.

### Impact and Influence

Index Coop's meta-governance system has evolved into one of the most successful implementations in DeFi. The protocol's influence extends across the ecosystem in several important ways:

**Voting Power Distribution**: Index Coop holds significant voting power in major protocols, often ranking among the top 10 or even top 5 token holders. This concentration of power, democratically controlled, creates a unique dynamic in DeFi governance.

**Strategic Positioning**: The ability to support proposals beneficial to the index methodology creates a positive feedback loop. Proposals that improve the protocols within DPI indices directly benefit Index Coop's products and, by extension, its users.

**Community Engagement**: Meta-governance has created new utility for INDEX tokens beyond basic protocol governance. Token holders actively participate in shaping the broader DeFi ecosystem, not just Index Coop itself.

**Revenue Generation**: The meta-governance system has opened new revenue opportunities through vote incentives and strategic partnerships. Protocols seeking to pass proposals often engage with Index Coop's community, creating value for INDEX holders.

### Strategic Partnership Examples

**Fei Protocol's Levered Meta-governance Play**

One of the most sophisticated examples of strategic governance involved Fei Protocol's campaign to list FEI on Aave. This case study demonstrates the power of understanding and leveraging meta-governance structures.

Fei Protocol faced a challenge: listing on Aave required proposing through Aave's governance, which demanded holding 80,000 AAVE tokens (worth approximately $20 million at the time). Direct acquisition of this voting power would have been prohibitively expensive. However, Fei's team identified that Index Coop's DPI held over 100,000 AAVE tokens.

The strategic play unfolded over several months. First, Fei Protocol engaged with the Index Coop community, building relationships and understanding the governance process. They then executed a token swap, acquiring 100,000 INDEX tokens for approximately $4 million. This amount was specifically calculated to meet Index Coop's quorum requirements for meta-governance votes.

When Fei proposed listing FEI on Aave through Index Coop's meta-governance, they effectively controlled $36 million worth of AAVE voting power with their $4 million INDEX investment, achieving a 9:1 leverage ratio. The proposal passed with broad support, with Index Coop's vote representing approximately 22% of the total "Yes" votes on Aave.

This example illustrates several key lessons about strategic governance. First, understanding the meta-governance landscape can create enormous leverage for achieving strategic objectives. Second, building relationships and taking time to understand governance processes is crucial for success. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of meta-governance makes it an attractive option for protocols seeking influence without massive capital requirements.

### Lessons Learned

The Index Coop case study provides several crucial insights for strategic governance:

**Product Design Creates Opportunities**: The structure of index products naturally creates meta-governance opportunities. This wasn't the initial intention but became one of Index Coop's most valuable features. Protocols should consider how their core products might create unexpected governance dynamics.

**Process Standardization is Essential**: Clear, repeatable processes are crucial for scalable meta-governance. Index Coop's well-documented procedures and automated systems enable them to participate effectively across multiple protocols without overwhelming operational capacity.

**Quorum Challenges Require Solutions**: Low participation rates necessitated the creation of the Meta Governance Committee. This pragmatic solution balances democratic ideals with practical needs, ensuring valuable voting power isn't wasted.

**Transparency Builds Trust**: Index Coop's commitment to transparent reporting and open governance processes has been crucial for maintaining community trust while wielding significant influence across DeFi. Regular reports on voting decisions and rationales help maintain legitimacy.
