# 2.4 Additional Strategic Governance Case Studies

### StakeDAO: The Alternative Aggregator

StakeDAO represents an alternative approach to the Convex model, demonstrating that multiple strategies can coexist in the same ecosystem. While Convex focused exclusively on Curve initially, StakeDAO took a multi-protocol approach from the beginning.

StakeDAO's strategy encompasses several key elements:

**Multi-Protocol Focus**: Rather than concentrating solely on Curve, StakeDAO offers liquid lockers for various tokens including CRV, ANGLE, APW, and others. This diversification strategy aimed to capture value across the DeFi ecosystem rather than dominating a single protocol.

**Integrated Product Suite**: Beyond liquid lockers, StakeDAO offers options strategies, a DEX aggregator powered by Paraswap, and yield optimization vaults. This integrated approach creates multiple touchpoints with users and revenue streams for the protocol.

**Governance Token Utility**: The veSDT token provides holders with the ability to direct SDT emissions to various strategies and liquid lockers, boost yields, and receive a share of protocol revenues. This creates a comprehensive value proposition for long-term holders.

Despite these innovations, StakeDAO faces significant challenges:

**Scale Disadvantage**: With only 3 million CRV locked compared to Convex's 102 million, StakeDAO lacks the critical mass to compete effectively in the Curve Wars. This demonstrates the importance of first-mover advantage and network effects in governance aggregation.

**Peg Issues**: The sdveCRV token has consistently traded at a significant discount to CRV, sometimes as low as 0.5 CRV per sdveCRV. This peg instability undermines the value proposition of liquid locking and creates negative feedback loops.

**Liquidity Challenges**: Lower liquidity for StakeDAO's wrapped tokens makes them less attractive for large holders who need to ensure they can exit positions without significant slippage.

The StakeDAO case illustrates that in winner-take-all governance markets, being second place can mean capturing only a small fraction of the opportunity. However, their multi-protocol strategy may prove more resilient long-term as new opportunities emerge.

### Redacted Cartel: Meta-governance Maximalism

Redacted Cartel emerged from the Olympus DAO fork ecosystem with a unique twist: rather than attempting to create a reserve currency, Redacted focused exclusively on accumulating governance power across DeFi. This pure-play meta-governance strategy has proven remarkably successful.

Since launching in December 2021, Redacted has built an $80 million treasury and become one of the most influential governance participants in DeFi. Their holdings include:

**CVX Accumulation**: As the second-largest protocol holder of CVX, Redacted wields enormous influence over Curve emissions. This position was built through a combination of bonding, strategic purchases, and yield optimization.

**Diversified Governance Portfolio**: Beyond CVX, Redacted has accumulated significant positions in other governance tokens including CRV, FXS, and various other strategic assets. This diversification provides multiple avenues for influence and revenue generation.

**Revenue Generation**: The protocol generates revenue through multiple streams:

* Bonding Fees: 10% fee on all BTRFLY minted through bonds
* Yield Farming: Sophisticated strategies leveraging treasury assets
* Bribe Income: Monetizing voting power through various bribe platforms
* Hidden Hand Fees: Revenue from their bribe marketplace platform

In Q2 2022 alone, the treasury generated approximately $2.8 million through these various revenue streams, demonstrating the viability of meta-governance as a business model.

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments: Redacted's acquisition of Votemak and transformation into Hidden Hand shows strategic thinking beyond simple token accumulation. By owning infrastructure for governance markets, they position themselves to benefit from the entire ecosystem's growth.

The protocol has also made strategic investments in early-stage projects like Curvance and JonesDAO, using their treasury and expertise to support ecosystem development while potentially capturing outsized returns.

Hidden Hand Marketplace: The evolution of Votemak into Hidden Hand represents a major strategic success. Hidden Hand has become a generalized bribe marketplace supporting multiple protocols:

* Aura Finance (Balancer's Convex equivalent)
* Balancer direct
* Floor DAO
* Frax Finance
* Ribbon Finance
* Tokemak

The platform's growth has been remarkable, with uptake on protocols like Balancer accelerating rapidly after Hidden Hand market launches. The partnership with Balancer, including reduced fees for direct treasury bribes, shows how infrastructure ownership can create strategic advantages.

#### PowerPool: Early Meta-governance Pioneer

PowerPool deserves recognition as one of the earliest projects to recognize the value of meta-governance, even before the term became widely used. Launched in 2020, PowerPool's vision was to create indices that accumulated governance power rather than just token exposure.

The Power Index (PIPT): This index product holds governance tokens from major DeFi protocols including YFI, COMP, AAVE, UNI, and others. Unlike traditional indices that might use synthetic exposure, PIPT holds actual tokens, inheriting their governance rights.

Active Meta-governance: PowerPool uses CVP (its governance token) holder votes to determine how to vote with the governance tokens held in indices. This creates a similar dynamic to Index Coop but with a focus on active governance participation rather than passive index management.

Transparency Focus: All meta-governance activities are recorded on-chain, providing complete transparency into how PowerPool exercises its influence. This transparency has been crucial for maintaining legitimacy despite holding significant voting power.

While PowerPool pioneered many meta-governance concepts, they've struggled to achieve the scale of newer entrants. This illustrates that in rapidly evolving markets, early innovation doesn't always translate to market dominance.

#### The Balancer Wars: Learning from Curve

The emergence of veBAL and the subsequent "Balancer Wars" demonstrates how successful governance models inspire imitation and innovation across the ecosystem. Balancer's adaptation of Curve's model included several thoughtful modifications:

veBAL Innovation: Rather than locking pure BAL tokens, veBAL requires locking 80/20 BAL/ETH liquidity pool tokens. This design serves dual purposes:

* Deepens BAL liquidity while tokens are locked
* Provides some ETH exposure to reduce volatility
* Creates additional trading volume for the protocol

Shorter Lock Period: Maximum lock of 1 year versus Curve's 4 years makes the system more accessible to users with shorter time horizons. This design choice trades off some stability for increased participation.

Aura Finance Emergence: Like Convex for Curve, Aura Finance emerged as the dominant aggregator for veBAL, quickly accumulating over 25% of supply. The speed of Aura's growth demonstrates how successful models can be rapidly replicated in DeFi.

**The Humpy Incident: Governance Capture Risks**

The Balancer ecosystem faced a significant governance challenge when a whale known as "Humpy" accumulated 35% of veBAL supply. This concentration allowed them to direct emissions disproportionately:

The Attack Vector: Humpy directed $1.8 million worth of BAL emissions over six weeks to a CREAM/WETH pool they controlled. The pool generated only $18,000 in protocol revenue during this period, representing a massive extraction of value.

Community Response: The Balancer community rallied to counter Humpy's influence:

* Aura Finance leveraged its veBAL holdings as a counterweight
* Governance proposals were passed to limit emissions to low-liquidity pools
* New safeguards were implemented to prevent similar attacks

Resolution: Eventually, a negotiated settlement was reached where Humpy agreed to use their voting power more constructively in exchange for the community not implementing punitive measures.

This incident highlights critical lessons:

* Governance token concentration creates systemic risks
* Active community oversight is essential
* Technical safeguards should anticipate adversarial behavior
* Sometimes negotiation beats confrontation in governance disputes

#### Cross-Protocol Strategic Initiatives

**The Rise of ve(3,3) Model**

Andre Cronje's ve(3,3) model, launched on Fantom as Solidly, represented an attempt to improve upon the veToken model with several innovations:

Key Improvements:

* Emissions adjust weekly based on circulating supply percentage
* Lockers receive rebasing rewards to maintain voting share
* NFT-based positions enable transferability while maintaining lock benefits
* Direct fee distribution to voters of productive gauges

While Solidly itself faced challenges, the model inspired numerous successful implementations including Velodrome on Optimism and Thena on BNB Chain.

**Multi-Chain Meta-governance Evolution**

As protocols expand across multiple chains, meta-governance becomes increasingly complex:

Cross-Chain Voting Coordination: Protocols must synchronize governance across deployments, requiring new technical solutions and organizational structures.

Liquidity Fragmentation: Managing liquidity incentives across chains requires sophisticated strategies to prevent fragmentation while maintaining efficiency.

Unified Governance Interfaces: Projects like Snapshot's multi-chain support and Tally's aggregation services have emerged to simplify cross-chain governance participation.
