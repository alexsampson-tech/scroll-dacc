# 5.2 Common Pitfalls and Failures

### Misaligned Incentives

When governance mechanisms allow value extraction without corresponding value creation, systems inevitably fail. The Balancer-Humpy incident perfectly illustrates this failure mode.

Humpy accumulated 35% of veBAL supply and used this power to direct emissions to pools they controlled, extracting value without contributing to protocol health. The core failure was allowing voters to benefit from emissions without requiring productive liquidity provision. When the largest LP is also the largest token holder voting for their own pools, governance becomes extractive rather than productive.

This misalignment extends beyond obvious attacks. Many governance systems fail because they reward participation without considering quality. Voters may support proposals that maximize short-term token prices or bribe income while damaging long-term protocol health. Without mechanisms ensuring voter skin in the game, governance becomes a coordination failure rather than a coordination mechanism.

### Complexity Without Value

Some protocols implement byzantine governance mechanisms that create friction without corresponding benefits. Complexity for its own sake reduces participation and may actually lead to worse outcomes than simpler systems.

Multi-stage voting processes with numerous committees and checkpoints might seem more democratic but often result in voter fatigue and low participation. If achieving quorum requires enormous effort, only the most motivated (often those with ulterior motives) will participate consistently.

Similarly, overly complex economic mechanisms can backfire. If users need advanced degrees to understand how rewards are calculated or governance power is determined, participation will concentrate among a small technical elite. The best governance systems balance sophistication with accessibility.

### Insufficient Flexibility

Governance systems must evolve with changing conditions, yet many are designed with rigid parameters that become outdated. Successful protocols build in mechanisms for evolution and adjustment from the beginning.

Hard-coded parameters without governance adjustment mechanisms create technical debt that compounds over time. As market conditions change, previously optimal settings become inefficient or even harmful. Protocols that require hard forks or complex migrations to adjust parameters often find themselves unable to adapt quickly enough.

The most successful governance systems include "meta-governance" provisions allowing the rules themselves to be updated through governance. This requires careful balance to prevent governance capture while enabling necessary evolution.

### Inadequate Safeguards

Without protection against adversarial behavior, governance systems invite exploitation. The history of DeFi is littered with protocols that assumed good faith participation only to be exploited by sophisticated actors.

Safeguards must operate at multiple levels:

**Technical Safeguards**: Time delays on parameter changes, maximum adjustment limits, and emergency pause mechanisms prevent rapid extraction of value. Multi-signature requirements for critical operations add security without excessive centralization.

**Economic Safeguards**: Requiring skin in the game through token locking, slashing mechanisms for misbehavior, and aligned incentive structures reduces the profitability of attacks. Making governance attacks expensive deters bad actors.

**Social Safeguards**: Active community monitoring, clear escalation procedures, and established norms around acceptable behavior create soft power constraints. Reputation matters even in pseudonymous systems.

**Legal Safeguards**: While controversial in DeFi, clear terms of service and potential legal recourse provide backstops against the most egregious behavior. The threat of doxxing and legal action has prevented some governance attacks.
