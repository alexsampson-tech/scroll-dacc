# 6.2 Partnership Deal Structures

### Formal Partnership Frameworks

The maturity of a DAO's organization significantly impacts partnership success. Well-structured DAOs can execute complex partnerships efficiently, while those with unclear governance struggle with even simple arrangements.

Successful partnerships require several organizational elements:

**Clear Governance Structure**: Partners need to understand who can make commitments and how decisions are executed. This includes defined roles for negotiation teams, clear delegation of authority from token holders, and established procedures for partnership approval. Ambiguity in decision-making authority has killed many promising partnerships.

**Legal Considerations**: While DAOs operate in a decentralized manner, partnerships often require legal frameworks for practical reasons:

Regulatory compliance becomes crucial when partnerships involve revenue sharing or token swaps that might be deemed securities in some jurisdictions. Tax implications of token swaps and revenue sharing need careful structuring to avoid unexpected liabilities. Liability frameworks must address potential risks while respecting the decentralized nature of DAOs.

The emergence of DAO legal wrappers in jurisdictions like Wyoming, Switzerland, and the Cayman Islands provides options for creating enforceable agreements while maintaining decentralization principles.

**Operational Integration**: Technical partnerships require significant operational coordination:

Development teams must align on technical standards and deployment timelines. Security procedures need coordination to ensure integrated systems maintain high security standards. Communication protocols establish how teams work together across time zones and organizational boundaries. Performance monitoring systems track partnership success and identify issues early.

### Case Study: Maker-Aave D3M Deep Dive

The Direct Deposit Module partnership between Maker and Aave deserves detailed examination as it represents best-in-class partnership structuring:

**Strategic Rationale**: Both protocols identified complementary needs that created natural partnership opportunities. Maker sought yield on idle DAI reserves while maintaining appropriate risk parameters. Aave needed stable liquidity to reduce rate volatility and attract institutional borrowers. The D3M created an automated solution benefiting both parties.

**Technical Implementation**: The D3M operates as an automated smart contract system requiring no ongoing manual intervention:

The module monitors Aave's DAI borrowing rates continuously. When rates exceed the ceiling parameter (set through Maker governance), the module deposits additional DAI. When rates fall below the floor, it withdraws DAI. This creates a stabilizing force that benefits all market participants.

Parameters are controlled through Maker governance, ensuring community oversight while enabling rapid response to market conditions. The system includes emergency shutdown mechanisms and careful risk parameters to protect Maker's interests.

**Economic Outcomes**: The partnership has generated significant value for both protocols:

Maker earns competitive yields on DAI that would otherwise sit idle, generating millions in annual revenue. The yields often exceed other deployment options while maintaining appropriate risk levels through Aave's proven security and risk management.

Aave benefits from stable DAI liquidity that attracts borrowers seeking predictable rates. The stabilized rates (1.7-3.8% range) compare favorably to the volatile rates seen before D3M implementation. This stability has helped Aave attract institutional users who require predictable borrowing costs.

**Governance Alignment**: An under-appreciated aspect of the partnership is how it creates ongoing governance alignment:

Maker accumulates AAVE tokens through liquidity rewards, giving it a voice in Aave governance. This creates incentives for Maker to support Aave's success beyond just the direct economic benefits. Similarly, Aave benefits from having a major protocol as an aligned stakeholder.

The partnership has survived multiple market cycles and protocol upgrades, demonstrating the robustness of well-structured strategic collaborations.

#### Negotiation Best Practices

Successful DAO partnership negotiations differ significantly from traditional business negotiations. The transparency, community involvement, and technical constraints create unique dynamics requiring adapted approaches:

Preparation Phase: Thorough preparation often determines negotiation success:

Understanding partner objectives requires researching their governance forums, analyzing their treasury composition, and identifying key stakeholders. This research should uncover not just stated goals but underlying motivations and constraints.

Defining clear success metrics before negotiations prevents scope creep and ensures alignment. These metrics should be quantifiable, achievable, and aligned with both parties' strategic objectives.

Preparing multiple deal structures provides flexibility during negotiations. Having alternatives ready enables quick pivots when certain structures prove unworkable due to technical or governance constraints.

Negotiation Process: The public nature of DAO governance requires careful process management:

Starting with shared goals rather than positions creates collaborative dynamics. Both parties should articulate what success looks like before diving into implementation details. This approach often reveals creative solutions that satisfy both parties' needs.

Focusing on value creation before distribution ensures sufficient incentive for both parties. Negotiations that start with "how to split the pie" often fail; those that start with "how to grow the pie" more often succeed.

Building in flexibility for future adjustments acknowledges that conditions change. Rather than trying to predict every scenario, creating mechanisms for adaptation ensures partnerships can evolve with circumstances.

Documentation Requirements: Clear documentation prevents future disputes and ensures community understanding:

Terms must be explicit and unambiguous, as interpretation disputes in DAOs can be particularly damaging. Technical specifications need detail sufficient for independent implementation. Economic terms should include examples and edge case handling.

Visual aids like flowcharts and diagrams help community members understand complex arrangements. Remember that documentation serves not just negotiating teams but entire communities who must vote on proposals.

Implementation Planning: The transition from agreement to execution often determines partnership success:

Phased rollouts reduce risk and allow for learning. Starting with limited scope pilots enables both parties to verify assumptions before full commitment. Clear milestones with associated deliverables create accountability and momentum.

Regular check-ins during implementation catch issues early. These should include not just technical teams but also community representatives who can flag concerns before they become problems.

Performance tracking from day one enables data-driven optimization. Establishing baselines and measurement systems before launch ensures objective evaluation of partnership success.
