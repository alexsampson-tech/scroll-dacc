# 6.1 Economic Models for DAO Partnerships

### Treasury Diversification Strategies

The concentration of DAO treasuries in native tokens represents both an expression of confidence and a significant risk factor. Even major protocols like Uniswap, with its $5 billion treasury held entirely in UNI tokens, face exposure to market volatility that could compromise their ability to execute long-term strategies. This recognition has driven increasing interest in treasury diversification strategies that balance risk mitigation with stakeholder interests.

Treasury diversification serves multiple strategic purposes beyond simple risk management:

**Operational Stability**: Diversified treasuries provide stable funding for operations regardless of native token price movements. This stability becomes crucial during bear markets when development and growth initiatives must continue despite reduced token values. Protocols with diversified treasuries can maintain team compensation, fund audits, and invest in growth without forced token sales at inopportune times.

**Strategic Flexibility**: Holdings in other protocols' tokens, stablecoins, and even real-world assets provide options for partnerships, acquisitions, and rapid deployment of capital. This flexibility enables protocols to seize opportunities that would be impossible with illiquid native token holdings.

**Partnership Currency**: Token swaps have emerged as a preferred mechanism for cementing strategic partnerships. Unlike traditional business partnerships based on contracts and trust, token swaps create quantifiable mutual stakes that align incentives over multi-year time horizons.

**Yield Generation**: Idle treasury assets can generate returns through various DeFi strategies, from simple lending to sophisticated structured products. This yield can fund operations without token sales or inflationary emissions.

### Token Swap Frameworks

DAO-to-DAO token swaps have evolved from simple exchanges to sophisticated partnership instruments. These arrangements require careful structuring to balance immediate needs with long-term alignment.

**Critical Components of Successful Token Swaps:**

**Valuation Methodology**: Determining fair exchange ratios requires sophisticated approaches that account for liquidity, volatility, and strategic value:

Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) calculations over 30-day periods have become the industry standard for reducing manipulation risk while providing fair value. Some protocols use Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for more liquid tokens where trading volume provides better price discovery. For complex situations, third-party oracle solutions or independent valuation committees provide additional objectivity.

**Vesting Schedules**: Long-term alignment requires carefully structured vesting that balances commitment with flexibility:

Typical vesting periods range from 2-4 years with varying structures. Linear vesting provides predictable token flows but may not align with partnership milestones. Cliff vesting (often 6-12 months) ensures minimum commitment before any tokens unlock. Back-weighted vesting increases unlock rates over time, rewarding long-term partnership success. Some innovative structures tie vesting to partnership KPIs rather than just time.

**Governance Rights**: The treatment of governance rights during vesting periods significantly impacts partnership dynamics:

Immediate governance rights allow partners to participate fully from day one, demonstrating trust and enabling strategic coordination. Delayed activation might be appropriate when partners need time to understand governance processes. Some structures provide observer rights during vesting, allowing participation without voting power. Graduated rights that increase with vesting completion balance immediate engagement with long-term commitment.

Exit Provisions: While partnerships aim for long-term success, prudent structuring includes provisions for various scenarios:

Buyback options at predetermined prices provide exit flexibility without market impact. Transfer restrictions prevent governance tokens from reaching adversarial parties. Tag-along rights ensure small partners aren't left behind in major changes. Drag-along provisions enable decisive action when necessary. Change of control clauses protect against fundamental shifts in partner protocols.

### Revenue Sharing Models

Sustainable partnerships increasingly include revenue sharing arrangements that create ongoing value alignment beyond initial token swaps. These models have evolved from simple fee splits to sophisticated value-sharing mechanisms.

**Integration-Based Revenue Sharing**

When protocols deeply integrate their technologies, sharing revenue from these integrations creates powerful incentives for optimization and growth:

**Fee Split Structures**: Direct sharing of transaction fees remains the simplest model. Typical splits range from 50/50 for equal partnerships to 80/20 for integrations where one party provides most of the value. Dynamic splits based on volume tiers incentivize growth while protecting smaller partners during ramp-up periods.

**Volume-Based Tiers**: Progressive fee sharing rewards scale and success. A typical structure might offer 10% revenue share up to $1M monthly volume, 15% from $1-10M, and 20% above $10M. This incentivizes partners to drive adoption while ensuring economics work at all scales.

**Performance Bonuses**: Additional rewards for achieving growth targets create upside alignment. These might include bonus payments for reaching TVL milestones, user acquisition targets, or strategic objectives. Structuring these as token grants rather than cash preserves treasury while sharing upside.

**Referral and Acquisition Programs**

Modern referral programs go beyond simple bounties to create sustainable user acquisition partnerships:

**Lifetime Value Sharing**: Rather than one-time payments, sophisticated programs share a percentage of lifetime revenue from referred users. This incentivizes partners to refer quality users who generate long-term value rather than just volume.

**Attribution Technology**: On-chain attribution tracking enables transparent and verifiable referral tracking. Advanced systems account for multi-touch attribution, recognizing that user acquisition often involves multiple touchpoints across partners.

**Tiered Rewards**: Different user segments warrant different compensation. A professional trading desk bringing million-dollar volume deserves higher rewards than retail referrals. Tiered systems recognize these differences while maintaining fairness.

**Joint Product Development**

The most ambitious partnerships involve creating entirely new products with shared ownership and economics:

**Development Cost Sharing**: Partners split initial development costs based on resources and capabilities. This might involve one partner providing technical development while another provides design and marketing, with costs netted against future revenues.

**Intellectual Property Arrangements**: Clear agreements on IP ownership prevent future conflicts. Options include joint ownership, licensing arrangements, or contribution to open-source projects where neither party owns but both can use freely.

**Revenue Distribution Models**: Sophisticated models account for various contributions. A typical structure might allocate revenue based on: development contribution (30%), ongoing maintenance (20%), user acquisition (25%), and liquidity provision (25%).
